          <b>Sources:</b> The Verra Registry is the primary source and the data is provided by the project developers on the registry. The "Data Acquisition Date" field in the dataset lists how current each row of data is. 
        </p>
        <p>This dataset is simply a compilation of disaggregated data hosted by Verra and combines the following information: first, data downloaded using Verra's bulk export tool; second, data scraped from the Verra Registry project listings pages to add missing summary fields; third, information about emissions reductions, project developers and locations extracted from PDF documents, spreadsheets or spatial datasets authored by the project developers or proponents and hosted on the registry.
        </p>
        <p>Another source (<a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4535931/v1">Karnik et al., 2024</a>) was used to get project locations for registered projects (this dataset of project locations was also created using information hosted on the Verra Registry). Websites and social media pages were used to find the entity type of organisations. The NbS Carbon Projects Dataset only covers West Africa for now.

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          The NbS Carbon Projects Dataset compiles high-level information about nature-based solutions (NbS) carbon offsetting projects in West Africa, with the aim to identify macro-trends in the emerging carbon offsetting sector in the region. The intention of compiling the dataset is to provide resources to analyse the future trajectory of this emerging development sector on a national and regional basis and to facilitate links to other fields of research, such as political economy.
        </p>
        <p>Data of this kind can help to identify national investment trends, the organisational and geographic networks that are forming, and aid the study of how public policy, economics, security and environmental risk encourages or inhibits sectoral growth and creates patterns of uneven development. 
        </p>
        <p>
          This first version of the dataset covers Verra projects in West Africa
          for the period 2024-2123. Future updates will include data from more
          registries, regions (with full coverage of Africa the current
          priority), implement country-level dashboards and analysis, and
          include historical data. As a first release, it may have flaws, and I
          appreciate your feedback to improve the resource – you can <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/samuel-mackinnon-50527b12b/">contact me here</a>
          if you spot any problems or if you would like to be involved.

      <section id="how-compiled">
        <h2>How the dataset was compiled</h2>
        <p>
          The process is quite simple, just more laborious than it ought to be
          due to the fragmented information system on Verra. Estimates on
          emissions reductions are buried in project design documents submitted
          and hosted on Verra as PDFs. (Rarely do projects supply the tables as
          spreadsheets.) Extracting tables from PDFs is not a smooth experience;
          in order to increase the efficiency of this, the relevant pages from
          the PDFs were isolated and Anthropics's Claude 3.5 Sonnet
          large-language model (LLM) was used to read and convert the data into
          a format suitable for spreadsheets. The LLM was fast at performing this task and accurate – the outputs
          were reviewed to ensure accuracy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once the emissions reductions data was compiled it was paired with
          basic information available through Verra's bulk export feature. All
          African projects under "Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use" were
          bulk exported from the Verra Registry search page. West African states
          were isolated from the dataset.
        </p>

        <p>
          Verra does not include all project summary information available on
          the dedicated project listings pages on the registry in the bulk
          export feature – such as the number of hectares involved in the
          project, the auditor, the number of proponents, and the origin of the project proponents by home
          country, or the summary description of the project. These were scraped
          from the project listings pages and added to the table.
        </p>

        <p>
          Verra also does not include coordinate locations for the projects. To
          obtain the latitude and longitude, therefore, an open dataset by
          <a href="https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4535931/v1">Karnik et al., 2024</a> that covers already registered projects was used,
          while the remaining projects were filled in by using geospatial
          datasets provided by the projects to Verra or by searching inside the
          project design documents for coordinates in cases where geospatial
          datasets were not provided.
        </p>

        <p>
          In cases where there are more than one project proponent, Verra lists
          "multiple proponents" under the "project proponent" section instead of
          providing their names and origin countries. This data must be obtained
          from the provided project design documents. For simplicity – as the
          ownership and benefit structures of projects are not known and,
          therefore, project outputs cannot be disaggregated easily among the
          multiple proponents – the dashboard selects a single project proponent
          to represent the project, assuming that there is a lead proponent. The
          lead proponent in this case is the first listed entity in the "Project
          Proponents" section of the project design documents. Their country of
          origin is also extracted. In the dataset, secondary and tertiary proponents are included.
        </p>

        <p>
          Verra also does not include explicit information on the entity type of
          project proponents, that is, whether they are a for-profit private
          company, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) or a governmental
          organisation. This information is obtained, where it is not obvious or
          identifiable in the project design documents, from a simple web search
          for organisational websites or social media pages.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="future-plans">
        <h2>Future plans</h2>
        <p>
          The dataset currently only includes Verra projects. In the future,
          projects from registries such as Gold Standard and Plan Vivo will be
          added. Also, only forecasts are included; historical data will be
          added in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          New regions will be added to the dataset, with the current priority
          full coverage of Africa. Country-level dashboards will also be
          included.
        </p>
        <p>
          Project status and project activity categories, currently taken
          exactly as they are listed from the registry database, may be replaced
          by higher-level abstractions. For example, where there are several
          activities in a project, the category may become "Mixed". Also, where
          registries differ in their terminology for activities or project
          status, abstractions may be required to unify them in the dataset.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="dataset-purpose">
      <h2>A note on the dataset and its purpose</h2>
      <p>
        Some caution ought to be exercised when using this data. Pay attention
        to the project status; projects "under development", for instance, may
        not progress and could fail to pass the tests necessary to become
        registered projects that can generate offsets. Even those projects that
        become registered face risks (mismanagement, environmental, political, social or financial) that, if left unmitigated, may result in projects partly or wholly failing and, therefore, not generating the planned emissions reductions. That said, usually those projects which succeed in passing validation
        should not experience such outcomes due to the strict tests they must first pass and the risk mitigation plans they should have in place. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, the emissions reductions data is based on a model of the future offsets resulting from the protected or restored ecosystems and the final results will differ. The actual emissions reductions will be confirmed through future monitoring events, which typically occur every 3 of 5 years following the start of a project. The models used are based on emprical research and provide the best estimate of the output of a project and, considered together, the possible supply of emissions reductions coming from each state or the region as a whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this dataset is to aid in understanding the current
        activity in the NbS carbon sector: where it is geographically
        concentrated, the spatial networks of organisations being formed, and to
        draw connections between national contexts and carbon project
        developments (or lack thereof) that are unfolding. (This last point will
        require using the data alongside other datasets or resources.) The scale
        of projects, even if there is uncertainty as to whether they will
        progress, is an important indicator of investment trends, the kind of
        supply of emissions reductions we can expect in the future, the
        organisations or organisation types that will be key players in the
        future, and in what states the NbS carbon sector is growing more
        rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to keep the dataset current, for users
        to do their own checks, to track non-progression of projects or for
        differences in predicted and actual emissions reductions, and to adjust
        the results accordingly. Equally as important as tracking positive
        outcomes is tracking negative ones; if trends emerge in terms of project
        failure, mismanagement or misjudgement in credit outputs, it will be
        important to understand the geographic, national and policy patterns
        influencing those outcomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ultimate intention of this dataset is to provide an easier and
        open way to track the developments of projects across geographic
        contexts by unifying the disaggregated data found on the carbon project
        registries.
      </p>
      </section>
      <section id="results">
        <h2>A note on the results</h2>
        <p>
          NbS carbon markets are still in their infancy, especially in West
          Africa. While global policy shifts and recognition of climate threats
          have raised the level of investment and activities in the sector, the
          number of active and in-development projects are small. The small
          number of developments can distort the rankings: some states on this
          list, such as Togo, host only a single project, but that project's
          forecasted emissions reductions are so large that it eclipses the
          potential outputs of most of the countries on the list that host
          multiple projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sector should be concerned about ensuring a path to more even
          development across the West African region and ensuring that those
          states with little activity can see more investments. There should
          also be concern about ensuring that national carbon project
          development networks are not dominated by single projects or
          developers, and that the risk exposure is therefore more evenly spread
          in the event that those projects may come under strain.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the regional NbS carbon sector matures and more projects come
          online, we may see an evening-out of activity across states as
          developers seek unexplored opportunities, or if governments attempt to
          create stronger business environments for carbon projects or, indeed,
          fill the gaps in private investment by setting up public carbon
          projects. On the other hand, the political-economic, environmental or
          security situation in some states may not improve or even decline,
          discouraging the development of projects.
